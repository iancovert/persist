# PERSIST

**Predictive and robust gene selection for spatial transcriptomics (PERSIST)** is a computational approach for selecting a small number of target genes. It relies on a reference scRNA-seq dataset, and it uses deep learning to identify genes capable of reconstructing the genome-wide expression profile, or alternatively any other target of interest (e.g., transcriptomic cell types). During the selection process, PERSIST binarizes gene expression levels to account for the measurement shift between scRNA-seq and FISH expression counts.
